    "Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function.\n",

    "List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map\n",

    "List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\n",
